# Hello! I'm Ashley ðŸ‘‹
## About Me
I'm a third year Computer Science (transfer!) student. Of my two quarters here so far, I would say the two classes I enjoyed and found interesting are **CSE 29** and **MATH 180A**. Outside of a computer science, I think statistics is *cool* ~~even if a bit hard sometimes~~.

Here's a quote I remember from my MATH 180A professor:
> If you're going to take only one thing away from this class, use the central limit theorem correctly!

But programming is also cool...
```C++
cout << "As seen with this super complicated program..." << endl;
```

There are a few goals I have for the quarter:
- [ ] Excel in all of my classes (straight As, hopefully?)
- [ ] ~~Survive?~~
  
Below, you can see what stuff I'm up to outside of school... or you can jump ahead to [art](#art) or [gaming](#gaming). Or maybe you want to go back to [README.md](README.md) for whatever reason.

## Fun Stuff
Outside of school, I enjoy drawing and video games.

### Art
I use two main drawing tablets:
- [Wacom One](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-displays/wacom-one) is the one I use at home. I bought it refurbished for a cheaper price.
- The one I bring around with me at school is a discontinued model <sup>It's super old...</sup>. [One by Wacom](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/one-by-wacom) is otherwise a good equivalent (probably).

### Gaming
I do enjoy playing games as well! "Recently" (by that, I mean through the school year when I had time), I went through a good few of the games (Though, I have not played all of them...). If I had to rank a top three, it'd probably go something like:
1. Final Fantasy XIII
2. Final Fantasy XVI
3. Final Fantasy X

I also enjoyed playing Pokemon growing up (and even now). As buggy and technically unimpressive relative to other games as it is, I really had a fun time with Scarlet & Violet.
